Data Mining formative and summative guide for Arush to take pointers/ideas from

ARUSH NOTE: 
1. original datasets had a huge number of values and these would be useful for analysing ony for dry times as well as for surge pricing + peak hours
2. I have only done the parts where there is a date time overlap with the weather. This is about 3800 odd values. Hence the analysis is only a comparison between dry versus rainy day scenarios.
